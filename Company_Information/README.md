## Materials


1. **Frame Material:**
   - **Graphite:** Commonly used due to its lightweight and high strength. Graphite rackets offer excellent control and power.
   - **Carbon Fiber:** Similar to graphite, carbon fiber is often blended with other materials for added strength and flexibility.

2. **Shaft Material:**
   - **Graphite/Carbon Fiber Composite:** Provides a balance of stiffness and flexibility for optimal performance.
   - **Titanium:** Sometimes used in combination with graphite for added strength and durability.

3. **Grommets:**
   - **Plastic or Nylon:** Grommets are used to protect the strings as they pass through the holes in the racket frame. These materials are commonly used due to their durability.

4. **Strings:**
   - **Nylon:** A popular choice for its durability and versatility. It comes in various thicknesses to cater to different playing styles.
   - **Polyester:** Known for providing more control and spin, but it may be less forgiving on the arm.
   - **Kevlar:** Offers excellent durability but is often combined with other materials due to its stiffness.

5. **Grip:**
   - **Synthetic Materials:** Most grips are made of synthetic materials like polyurethane or rubber for comfort and durability.
   - **Leather:** Some players prefer leather grips for a traditional feel, but they may require more maintenance.

6. **Handle:**
   - **Wood or Synthetic Composite:** The handle provides the grip and connection between the player and the racket. Materials like cork or foam are often used for comfort.

7. **T-joint:**
   - **Metal/Alloy:** The T-joint connects the shaft and the head of the racket. It's typically made of metal or alloy for strength.

8. **Adhesive:**
   - **Epoxy Resin:** Used to bond various parts of the racket, such as the frame and shaft, ensuring a strong and durable connection.

## What I need?

- I need a person who can develop an application where the customer can see the different options of rackets. 
- Another option is where the customer can request for a personalized racket, so then the person will choose all the things that the person wants to make it especial and comfortable.
- The next option requires entering the budget available for the customer. So with the range of budget available, show the different types of rackets that the person can get.
- The last option involves the strings for the racket, showing the ones available for that model, and gives the suggestion of the tension for the strings.
